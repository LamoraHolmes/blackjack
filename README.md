# Personal Blackjack Project

A created this project in order to start learning Python and begin with the basics, like variables handling, conditional statements, loops and working with lists. 

The basic functionality of a Blackjack game is included but things like splitting are not.

Additionally, the project is missing a few rules and finer details in a Blackjack game but since I consider Blackjack not a great game 
at all, I wasn't much interested in adding them to the code. (Better learn chess ;)
